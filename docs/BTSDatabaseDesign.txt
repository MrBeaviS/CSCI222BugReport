BTS Database Design

Proposition

	The Bug Tracking System (BTS) database will be required to store User and Report information. On first run/start up, there are 3 possibilities:
		
		1) This is the first run (install) so a database will need to be created
		2) The program has been moved to a new system so a new database will need to be created and all previous data will need to be loaded
		3) There has been a error/crash of some sort and the database needs to be restored

	When installing, this can be accomplished by a small script that will create the required schema (tables, users etc). This script can be part
	of the package when distributing. (possible folder called required files).

	When moving the program to a new system there will need to be an "import" ability that will import the database either from an exported file or
	from a server

	When there has been an error/crash the program will operate the same as if the program was moved. as a failsafe when the program is shutdown, or
	at a pre determined time, the database will back up and save a file in a location
