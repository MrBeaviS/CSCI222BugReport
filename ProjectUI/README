MICHAEL
Please finsih Admin User Profiles and the search that goes with it.
Please finish comments displaying at the bottom table
Please finsih editing current parameters and sending an update to the Database
Please add keyword search to the search functions and procedures.
Please get counts happening on reports
Please change Rep to be an integer so it can be increased and decreased as per specification.
I dont think there is a need for the ENUM("Reviewer", "Developer", "Triage"); Security Level makes this obsolete
we can create front end functions that check the integer and assignes the approriate string.
